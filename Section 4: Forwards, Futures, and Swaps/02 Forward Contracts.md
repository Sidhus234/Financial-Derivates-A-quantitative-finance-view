# Forward Contract:
- A forward contract is an agreement between a seller and a buyer in which they agree that the seller will sell an asset to the buyer at a certain time in the future at a price agreed upon at the time of entering contract.
- Some terminology for forward contracts:
  - __long position:__ The position of the buyer
  - __short position:__ The position of the seller
  - __expiration date or expiry:__ The agreed trade date
  - __forward price:__ The contracted price

- A forward contract is an example of a derivative product. The traded asset is the underlying of a forward.
- The long and short terminology corresponds to the parties exposure to the underlying. The buyer has a long position on the underlying and the seller has a short position.
- When a forward is entered into, the forward price is not arbitrary. It is calculated in such a way that the value of the forward contract, upon entering it, is 0.
- The requirement that the forward contract have cost 0 at origination ties the forward price to the current spot price, that is to the current market price of the asset.
- The underlying assets on which forwards are written include assets from stocks, foreign currencies, commodities, and interest rate products.
- Forward contracts are privately negotiated between counterparties, on OTC markets and can be highly customized to suit the two counterparties.
- Usually one of the counterparties is a financial institution, or dealer. The other counterparty can be an end use (non-financial entity) or another dealer. The primary reason for end users to use forwards (and other derivatives) is usually risk management.
- At expiry, forward contracts can be settled in one of the two ways: delivery or cash settlement.
  - Settlement by delivery means the seller exchanges the underlying asset for the contracted price with the buyer.
  - In a cash settled deal the party with a negative cash position at expiry compensates the other party with cash.

- Because of their nature as privately negotiated and customized deals, forward contracts are illiquid securities that usually are held to expiry.
- Counterparty credit risk is also a serious consideration for forwards.
- These last points are in contrast to exchange-traded future contracts.

### Example 1:
Suppose you are a financial advisor to Nancy, a young heir who has just inherited $1,000,000. There is a particular stock, gqqx, which she has been studying and believes is on the verge of a massive increase in share price. She wants to invest half her inheritance in this stock, but her inherintance will not be disburshed for 6 months. She is worried the stock price will rise befre that, and she'll miss her chance. What product can you offer her to protect her from this?

- Gqqx stock is currently trading at $120. You do calculations, based on current interest rates, and you tell Nancy you can offer her a 6 month forward contract to buy 4000 shares of gqqx at $125/share.

### Example 2:
Suppose you are the CFO of an import/export company basedin the US. The company has made a large scale in Europe, nd will be receiving a payment of 10,000,000 Euros in 3 months, which must then be exchanged for USD. The current Euro/USD exchange rate is $1.25/Euro. The CEO is afraid the Euro may decline in the next 3 months, and asks you how to reduce this risk. What ideas can you offer the CEO?
- Tell the CEO that you should enter into a 3 month FX forward contract for 10 million Euros, which can be done for a forward rate of $1.30/Euro.

### Example 3:
Forwards on bonds are very similar to forwards on stocks or any other asset. If aninvestor plans to buy or sell a bond or a bon dportfolio at some time in future the customizable nature of forward contracts are ideal if the investor wants to be protected against adverse price changes. The investor can contact brokers and dealers to negotiate a suitable contract.
- As an example, consider a forward contract for a T-bill, a pure discount instrument issued by the US treasury.
- In a forward contract on a T-bill the long party would agree to buy the T-bill from the short party at some date in the future, but before the maturity of the bond, at a price agreed upon at the origination of the forward contract. A typical forward contract might require delivery of a 180 day T-bill in 90 days with a forward price of 40.98 per $100 par.

### Example 4:
Suppose you an investment advisor managing a stock portfolio for a client who plans to liquidate the portfolio in 6 months. You are concerned about a downturn in the stock market in the next 6 months. How do you protect the portfolio from price risk?
- You can contact a derivatives dealer and enter into a forward contract obligating the dealer to purchase the portfolio from you at a price you agree to now.

__Remark:__ Most of the examples considered here reflect the customizable nature of forward contracts.
