# Future Contracts
- A futures contract is a contract between a seller and buyer to sell a certain asset at a fixed time in the futre at a price that is agreed to when the contract is written.
- The main difference between forwards and futures: futures are traded on exchanges.
- A small sample of future exchanges: 
  - the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and its subsidiaries
  - Subsidiaries of ICE (Intercontinental Exchange): NYSE, New York Board of Trade, International Petroleum Exchange
  - Euronet in Europe

- A futures contract can only exist on a particular underlying if an exchange decides to create it
- But futures contracts are available for many underlying assets.
  - __Agricultural Commodities:__ Wheat, corn, live cattle, diary, orange juice
  - __Energy Commodities:__ Crude Oil, natural gas, power
  - __Metals:__ Gold, Nickel, Copper
  - __Equity Products:__ S&P500 index, single stocks
  - __Fized Income Products:__ US Treasury notes, Bonds, interest rates
  - __Foreign Currencies__

### Future Contracts are Standardized
- Each exchange defines the exact specifications of the futures contracts traded on their platform.
- __Underlying asset requirements:__ underlying asset must meet certain conditions to be acceptable e.g. the grade of wheat, the maturity of bonds
- __Contract size:__ E.g. 100 barrels of crude oil, $100,000 bond face value.
- __Delivery Month:__ The month when delivery must be made is specified. Futures are often referred to by the delivery month, eg "the March corn futures".
- __Delivery location:__ For physical commodities the location where the asset must be delivered is specified.
- The specification of a futures contract leaves certain issue ambiguous to a point. The effect to this ambiguity is to provide certain optionalities in the contract, mostly enjoyed by the short.
  - The short may initiate delivery at any eligible date during the delivery month.
  - The short may make delivery at any eligible warehouse or facility as specified in the contract (for physical commodities).
  - For bond futures, the short may deliver any one from a set of eligible bonds.
  - Modulo these (secondary) ambiguities, it is essential that the delivery process be clearly and explicitly defined to ensure the linkage between future and spot prices.

- Only a small percentage of futures contracts are held until expiry. Usually they are terminated or closed out prior to expiry.
- On an exchange the closing out process is implemented by entering into the opposite position, offsetting the original position.
- The exchange will treat both positions as terminated.
- For instance, if you had a long position on 10 October natural gas futures, you could close out your position by entering a short position in 10 October natural gas futures.
- Very few investors in futures contracts intend to hold them until delivery.
- Futures are held primarily for the exposure they provide to the underlying asset, for risk management or speculation purposes and also for leverage.
- Futures contracts reliably provide this exposure to the underlying because futures prices track the cash price closely.
- The close relationship between futures and spot prices is a direct consequence of the linkage between them implied by the possibility of delivery.
