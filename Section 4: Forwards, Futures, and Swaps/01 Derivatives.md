# Derivatives:
- Derivatives are financial products or assets whose structure and value is derived from another assset.
- The base asset is called the __underlying asset__ but usually it is simply referred to as the underlying.
- The linkage of the derivative to the underlying is usually through the payoffs of the derivative. The payoffs are the revenues paid to holders of the derivative product.
- The payoffs of a derivative are usually determined by the price of the underlying asset, at some point in the derivative contract's life, often on its expiration date.
- The main tool for linking the derivative value to the underlying price is arbitrage.

### Terminology:
- The price of the underlying asset is referred to as the __cash price__ or the __spot price__ to distingiush it from the price of the derivative.
- The underlying assets are said to be traded on the __cash market__, when the underlying is a cash produuct as is usually (but not always) the case.
- Profit and loss, referring to changes in the value of an investment or financial position is conventionally denoted __P&L__. The position may be a single asset (cash prodcut or derivative) or a portfolio.

### Assumptions:
In our treatment of derivatives, certain simplifying assumptions will be in effect, unless otherwise stated (Though none of them hold true in real life)
- Transaction costs are zero.
- Unlimited investing or borrowing at the risk free rate.
- No restrictions on short selling any asset.

### Products:
- Forwards and futures are contracts that lock in the price 2 parties will buy and sell an asset for at some future date.
- Options are similar to forwards, but one party has the right not to participate at the time the contract expires.
- Swaps are linked to interest rates, allowing a floating interest rate to be switched to a fixed rate.
