# Derivatives:
- Derivatives are financial products or assets whose structure and value is derived from another assset.
- The base asset is called the __underlying asset__ but usually it is simply referred to as the underlying.
- The linkage of the derivative to the underlying is usually through the payoffs of the derivative. The payoffs are the revenues paid to holders of the derivative product.
- The payoffs of a derivative are usually determined by the price of the underlying asset, at some point in the derivative contract's life, often on its expiration date.
- The main tool for linking the derivative value to the underlying price is arbitrage.

### Terminology:
- The price of the underlying asset is referred to as the __cash price__ or the __spot price__ to distingiush it from the price of the derivative.
- The underlying assets are said to be traded on the __cash market__, when the underlying is a cash produuct as is usually (but not always) the case.
- Profit and loss, referring to changes in the value of an investment or financial position is conventionally denoted __P&L__. The position may be a single asset (cash prodcut or derivative) or a portfolio.

### Assumptions:
In our treatment of derivatives, certain simplifying assumptions will be in effect, unless otherwise stated (Though none of them hold true in real life)
- Transaction costs are zero.
- Unlimited investing or borrowing at the risk free rate.
- No restrictions on short selling any asset.

### Products:
- Forwards and futures are contracts that lock in the price 2 parties will buy and sell an asset for at some future date.
- Options are similar to forwards, but one party has the right not to participate at the time the contract expires.
- Swaps are linked to interest rates, allowing a floating interest rate to be switched to a fixed rate.

# Derivative Markets:
- Derivatives mostly trade on either _over the counter (OTC) markets_ or on organized __exchanges__.
  - OTC markets consist mostly of bilateral deals between counterarties that deal directly with each other.
  - Organized exchanges where derivatives are traded include the Ney York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Euronext for example.

## Exchange-traded Products:
There are many advantages to derivatives traded on organized exchanges.
  - Exchange-traded products are standardized.
  - Exchange-traded products are generally much more liquid that OTC products.
  - Because exchange trading is public, there is a high degree of price transparency for exchange-traded markets.
  - Exchange-traded products have much less exposure to counterparty credit risk (default risk).

## Over the Counter (OTC) Markets:
The OTC markets consist of private deals directly negotiated between counterparties.
  - They are transacted between broker-dealers and their clients (end users) or between broker-dealers themselves, through decentralized networks, through computer networks or telephone.
  - OTC deals are private and customizable. There is little price transparency in OTC markets.
  - The OTC markets are comparatively lightly regulated.
  - But counterparty credit risk is a major consideration for OTC deals.


# Counterparty Credit Risk:
Counterparty credit risk or default risk, is the risk in any derivative deal that one of the parties on the contract might fail to meet their obligations. 
  - For instance, the party in the long position may fail to pay the contracted price at contract expiry.
  - Counterparty credit risk is not a major concern for exchange-traded products, which are marked to market and for which the exchange itself acts as the counterparty to every investor trading on the exchange.
  - Because OTC contracts are bilateral deals between two private parties, there is always the risk that one of them could fail to meet their contractual obligations.
  - Largely because of probles with counterparty risk during the 2008 financial crisis, there has been regulatroy push in subsequent years to move standardized products trading on OTC markets onto exchanges. This is an initiative that remains in progress till date.
