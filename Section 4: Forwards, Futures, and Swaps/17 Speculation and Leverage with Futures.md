# Speculation and Leverage with Futures
 Futures can be used for risk management activities. It can also be used for speculation.
 - In risk management, a market participant uses the future position to offset, and thus reduce, an exposure he already has in an existing portfolio. The purpose is to reduce risk.
 - A speculator's intent, on the other hand,is to obtain an exposure she does not already have. SO in contract to risk management, the purpose is to increase risk.
 - If an investor wants to have a long exposure to crude oil (because she expects the price to risk), there are at least 2 ways to do this:
  - Take the outright long position in the cash market (estentially buy oil)
  - Take a long futures position.

- The futures position provides the same exposure to the underlying price as the equivalent cash position. There are often many advantages to obtaining this exposure in futures markets rather than in the cash market. 
  - Futures markets are often much more liquid than cash markets
  - For commodities, there are considerable costs and logistical complications to taking cash positions, such as storage, insurance, and transportation.
  - Probably the biggest advantage of all is leverage futures provide.

## __Leverage:__ 
- __Leverage__ refers to the possibility for an investor to obtain a much larger exposure on the financial markets than the funds she invests. 
- Leverage is often thought of to mean borrowing. Margin accounts on the cash equity market are like this.
- Futures contracts provide a different form of leverage. An investor can take a futures position with only enough funds to satisfy the margin requirements.
- By posting margin, and investor can obtain an exposure on the underlying market with, typically 5-10% of the funds that would be required for the same exposiure on the cash market.
