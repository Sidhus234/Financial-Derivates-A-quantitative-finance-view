# Futures Prices
- The futures price associated with a futures contract is the contracte dprice.
- We done by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K_T(t)"> the futures price for a contract originated at time _t_ and expiring at time _T_.
- Like forward prices, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K_T(t)"> is the contract price that makes a futures contract entered at time _t_ have 0 value.
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K_T(t)"> are prices negotiated on futures markets, the outcome of supply and demand forces on futures markets.
- Thus the notation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K_T(t)"> does not denote the price contracted in any particular futures contract. It represents a market price observed on markets at time _t_. It is market's assessment of the fair futures price for contract originated at time _t_ and expiring at time _T_.
