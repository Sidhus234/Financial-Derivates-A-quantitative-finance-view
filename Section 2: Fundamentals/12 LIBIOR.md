# LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate
- Future of LIBOR is uncertain, and may have a reduced rule in finance in future
- It is a measure of the rate at which large and secure London-based banks can secure funding, in different currencies from other such banks
- Historically it emerged from the Eurodollar market in London in the late 1960s, with London based banks issuing loans to businesses and governments from their holdings of US dolars.
- __Eurodollar__ refers to United States currency that is held outside of United States, hence outside of purview of United States regulators. 
- As the LIBOR rates grew in influence, eventually the British Bnaker's association took responsibility for administering it.
