# Continuous Compouding

- corresponds to instantaneous compounding of all interest income. As soon as interest is paid, new interest is paid on it. 
- Mathematically it is the limit of periodic compounding as the period goes to 0 or the frequency goes to infinty
- As an approximation, the accuracy can be optimized by choosing the continuously compounded rate equivalent to prevailing periodically compounded rates
- We can pass from periodic compounding to continous compounding by increasing the compounding frequency _m_ to infinity and passing to the limit.
