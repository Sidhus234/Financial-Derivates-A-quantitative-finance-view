# Commodities
- There are active and liquid capital markets based on a wide range of physical commodity assets.
- These include both cash (spot) markets, and active derivative markets.
- There are 3 major segments of the global commodities market: agricultural, metals, and energy.
- The __agricultural markets__ are further divided into segments:
  - __Grains:__ soyabean, corn, wheat
  - __Soft Commodities:__ cotton, sugar, coffee, coca
  - __Livestock__

- The __metals markets__ include:
  - __Precious metals:__ gold, silver, platinum, palladium
  - __Industrial metals:__ copper, zinc, aluminium

- The __energy markets__ include:
  - __Crude oil:__ most liquid and active commodity worldwide
  - __Natural gas__
  - __Coal__
  - __Power (Electricity)__

# Commodity Prices:
- Unlike bonds and stocks, commodities cannot be thought of as an asset that entitles its owner to a future stream of cash flows.
- Discounted cash flow analysis does not play a role in pricing commodities.
- Commodity prices are viewed as the product of whatever supply and demand prevail on markets at any time.
- Nevertheless, there are identifiable trends in commodity price time series, and other market driven features such as seasonality.
- And commodity prices exhibit high levels of volatility. related to the arrival of news and other information, but also driven purely by trading activity.
- Commodty assets are exposed to many of the same classes as risk as other assets, such as price risk and credit risk.
- However, there are certain sources of risk which are unique to commodities as physical assets.
  - These include transportation related risks and risks associated with storage of a physical good.
  - Transportation risks include risks of damage or destruction as well as transportation price risk.
  - And there are risks associated with the quality of the commodity, which interact with other risk sources. For instance, for agricultural commodities, there is the risk of spoilage.

# Inventory, Storage, and Convenience Yield:
- The theory of inventory is one of the major advances in the understanding of commodity assets.
- Inventories have a major impact on price volatilty, in an inverse relationship: the higher the inventory levels of a commodity the lower the price volatility.
- For both suppliers and consumers, holding inventories allows participans in the life cycle of a commodity to operate stable in the face of demand or supply shocks.
- Thus, the existence of inventories stabilizes commodity prices.
- Holding inventory incurs storage costs.
- At the same time holding inventory is regarded as having economic benefits.
- This view is supported by the fact that companies hold inventories even when the prevailing market price of a commodity is higher than expected future prices.
- The posession of inventory allows companies to respond to jumps in demand quickly and at low cost.
- Also, the posession of inventories allows the commodities to be put to productive use.
- It is standard to model this benefit in a way similar to dividend yields on stock, with what is known as a __convenience yield:__
- Convenience yields are implemented as a continously compounded return accruing to holdings of a commodity. 
- But since holding inventory also incurs storage costs, the benefit must be adjusted to take these costs into account.
- We may model the storage costs as a negative yield.
- The combined effect may thus be modelled by a net yield"
