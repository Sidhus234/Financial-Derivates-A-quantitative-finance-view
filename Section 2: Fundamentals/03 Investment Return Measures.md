# Investment Return Measures
- Interest rates quantify a return on investment

## Gross Return
- Let _V(t)_ be value of investment or asset at time _t_. One of the simplest ways to represent the return on the investment from time _t_ to _t + tau_ is the __Gross Return__

- This measure contains all the information of how profitable the investment has been, ie what return it has yileded

## Net Return

</p>
- This expreses the profit earned on the investment as a fraction or percentage of the initial investment _V(t)_
- Net Return = Gross Return - 1
