# Assumptions about Interest Rates
- __These assumptions hold unless explicit notification is given that different assumptions are being made.__

<ol>
  <li>Interest rates are risk free</li>
  <li>Term structures are flat</li>
  <li>Interest rates are continously compounded</li>
  <li>Interest rates are constant in time</li>
  </ol>
  
  - Typically, interest rates will be represented as a variable, _r_, understood to be a deterministic and constant function of time and term, and a risk free continously compounded rate.
  - This is a crude model of interest rates, but good enough for non-fixed income products.

- The main products for which some of these assumptions will be relaxed are:
  - __Bonds and interest rate products__
    - Usually the compounding convention will be choosen the same as the frequency of coupon payments, and term structures are usually not flat.

  - __Swaps:__
    - Interest rates will be either semiannually or quarterly compounded and will not be constant in time.
