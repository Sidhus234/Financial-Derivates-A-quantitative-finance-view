# Interest Rate Conversions
- The gross return of an investment at a periodically compounded interest rate equals the future value of an initial investment of $1
  - Let _P(t)_ be the future value of an investment _X_ in _t_ years. Then

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{P(t)}{X} = \frac{(1 %2B \frac{r_m(t)}{m})^{mt}}{X} X = (1 %2B \frac{r_m(t)}{m})^{mt}">

# Interest rates are equivalent:
- if they lead to same total return
  - To calculate equivalent interest rates we can equate the gross or net returns, which is the same as equating the future value of $1
  - To express _(r_m(t))_ in terms of _(r_k(t))_, equate:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math= (1 %2B \frac{r_m(t)}{m})^{mt} = {(1 %2B \frac{r_k(t)}{k})^{kt}}">

  - Solving for _(r_m(t))_

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math= r_m(t) = m * (1 %2B \frac{r_k(t)}{k})^{k/m} - m">
