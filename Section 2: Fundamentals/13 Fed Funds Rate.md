# US banking system
- The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the US
- Thus the Federal Reserve, universally referred to as "The Fed", is the body responsible for conducting monetary policy in the US.
- One of the primary methods the Fed uses to implement monetary policy is by influencing short term interest rates.
- Thefed funds rate is the interest rate the Fed exerts control over most directly.

## How Fed Funds Rate is defined
  - The Fed mandates that US banks must keep a certain fraction of their deposits in reserve in an account with the Fed.
  - At any time a bank in the federal reserve system may find that their reserve balance is below requirements. Other banks in the system may find that they have excess reserves. 
  - One way for the bank that falls short to raise its balance to the required evel is to borrow from a bank with excess reserves.
  - This market of (unsecured) interbank lending is known as the federal funds market and the overnight interest rate at which the lender bank provides funds to the borrower bank is the __federal (fed) funds rate.__
  - The fed funds rate, which determines the short term funding costs for US banks, is the primary tool through which the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy.
  - The Federal Open Markets Comittee (FOMC), the unit of the Fed that sets monetary policy, sets a target for the fed funds rate at meetings held 8 times per year.
  - The Fed does not directly mandate or set the fed rfunds rate. The Fed steers the effective fed funds rate, the rate actually realized on markets, to the target level through open market operations.
  - Mostly this consists of buying and selling US government debt securities from banks.
  - In this way, the Fed controls the reserve levels of banks and keeps the fed funds rate closer to the target level.

## Others:
- In recent (20-30 years) LIBOR and thw Fed Funds Rate have been viewed as 2 of the most fundamental short term interest rates.
- Since the financial crisis, it is now known that LIBOR is to a large degree divorced from actual market activity, and have gotten more so since then as Eurodollar interbank lending market has declined.
- In contraxst, the effective fed funds rate is an entirely market based rate determined by lending activity in the fed funds market.
- As a result, the relative importanc eof the fed funds rate as a benchmark interest rate has grown since the financial crisis.
