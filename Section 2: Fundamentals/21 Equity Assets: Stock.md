# Common Stock:
- denotes securities implying an ownership position, or equity, in a company.
- The basic indivisible unit of stock is a __share__ and the owners of a company's stock are called __shareholders.__
- A corporation is brought into existance when it is granted a __charter__ or __certificate of incorporation.__ This document outlines the rights of shareholders.
- Owners of common stock are paid __dividends__ out of the company earnings as per the dividend policy adopted by the management.
- Common stock holders have voting rights in the company as specified in its charter.
- Common stock is a residual claim: 2 classes of claimants have priority in receiving payments from the company.
- Debt holders receive interest payments before dividends are paid, and are the first to be compensated in the case of bankruptcy.
- And preferred stock holders have priority after debt holders in receiving payments.
- Preferred stock holders have priority over common stock holders in receiving dividends and in reimbursement in a liquidation of the company.
- But preferred stock holders do not have voting rights and have limited potential for capital gain, because their dividend is usally fixed.
- All examples of stock in this course are common stock.

# Stock Markets:
- The market for company stocks can be divided into those for privately held companies and those for public companies
- The stock of privately held companies does not trade publicly. Shares in the company are bought and sold in private deals, in a market with little transparency.
- Publically traded stocks trade on prominent stock exchanges such as New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ and Euronet, or on __over the counter__ markets.
- The over the counter (OTC) markets consist of networks of dealers who make private transactions amongst themselves and with customers.

# Stock Prices:
- The common stock of companies is traded on markets and as such share prices are primarily the outcome of the forces of supply and demand.
- There is valuation theory for stock, based on the same core principles as bond valuation theory.
- Similar to bonds, the fair value of a stock is calculated as the present value of the stream of income the stoc is expected to generate.
- The major difference with bonds is that the future income stream is uncertain.
- A key technical difference with bond theory is therefore that for stock valuation the discount factos must incorporate the risk of the uncertain future cash flows.
- One way to quantify the future incomeof a company is to estimate the dividends it will pay shareholders, and compute the present value of the stream of dividend payments. These are known as __divident discount models.__
- But the import of the __Modigliani-Miller Theorem__ is that a company's dividend policy is immaterial to its valuation. Rather it is future earnings that determine the company's worth today.
- Regardless of the specific valuation model, it is generally agreed that expectations about the future profitability of a company are the main determinants of stock value.

# Volatility of Stock Prices:
- It is the accepted view that the fundamental value of company stock should reflect the expected earnings of the company.
- The announcement of the news relevant to company fundamentals drives adjustments and volatility in stock prices.
- The volatility level of most stock prices observed in markets is viewed as too high to be justifiable solely based on expectations.
- Purely speculative activity, divorced from economic fundamentals, is seen as a major source of excess volatility of stock prices.

# Dividends:
- Certain comapnies pay cash dividends to their shareholders, at the discretion of the company management and board of directors.
- Dividends are paid out of the company;s earnings, either current or retained.
- Dividend paying companies tend to be older more established companies.
- Younger growing companies usually reinvest their earnings into further growth (research, product development , etc) and tend not ot pay dividends.
- Dividends are normally paid on a per share basis, so that a company will typically announce some cash dividend tha twill be paid per share to stockholders.
- To ensure clarity about which investors are eligible to receive a dividend, an __ex-dividend__ date is specified as part of the dividend announcement, whish is the cutoff date for eligibility to receive the dividend.
- Investors who purchase the stock on or after the ex-dividend date will not receive the dividend.
- The share price drops by about the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date, due to market forces.
- If we are stockholders, holding _N_ shares of stock, then when a company makes a dividend announcement, we know the exact cash value of the dividend payment we will receive.
  - Suppose we hold 1000 shares of Company _A_ stock, and the Company _A_ management announces a dividend of $15 per share. Then we can treat the dividend as a known payment of $15000 that we will receive on the divident payment date.

</p>

  - We may also measure the dividend as a yield. If Company _A_'s stock is currently trading at $250 per share, then the dividend yield received is 6%

<p align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Dividend yield = \frac{15}{250} = 0.06">
</p>

  - Dividend yield provide a measure of the rate of return a dividend offers, and allows comparisions of investments in different stocks with, in general, different stock prices.
