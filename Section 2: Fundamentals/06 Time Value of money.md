# Time value of Money
- Idea that $1 received in future is not worth $1 today (It is worth less than $1)
- is used to justify the existance of interest rates

# Present Value
- The __present value__ of _X_ is the amount that should be invested today at prevailing interest rates so that at time _t_ the investment will be worth exactly _X_
- Denote the present value of _X_ by _PV_. Then _X_ is the future value of _PV_.
  - Let _r_ be the prevailing risk free annually compounded interest rate.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(1 %2B r)^t PV = X">
  </p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PV = \frac{X}{(1 %2B r)^t}">
</p>
- Present values can be expressed in terms of other interest rates with different compounding conventions.
  - Suppose _(r_m)_ is periodically compounded interest rate, with compounding frequency _m_.
  - The future value relation
<p align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(1 %2B \frac{r_m}{m})^{mt} PV = X">
</p>
  - implies the present value of X is
<p align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PV = \frac{X}{(1 %2B \frac{r_m}{m})^{mt}}">
</p>
- If _(r_c)_ is continously compounded then we have
<p align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{r_ct} PV = X">
</p>
  - which implies
<p align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PV = e^{-r_ct}X">
  </p>
