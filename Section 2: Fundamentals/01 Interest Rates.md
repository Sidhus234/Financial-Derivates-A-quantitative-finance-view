# Interest Rates:
- are measures of the price charged in the economy to borrow money
- __Terminology:__ The charge levied to borrow money is called __interest__
- __Principal:__ is the amount of money borrowed in a loan. 
- The __interest rate__ is the fraction of the principal of a loan that will be charged as interest per unit time.
- The __annual interest rate__ is an interest rate for which the implicit time unit is 1 year
-- Quotes interest rates are usually annual interest rates. In this course interest rates are annual rates unless otherwise stated.

# Mathematics of Interest Rates:
- Suppose we take out a loan for X (ie principal = X) at an annual interest rate of r. If we hold the loan for 1 year how much interest will be charged:
	- Interest rate for 1 year = rX
- If we make no payments, then our total debt after 1 year is:
	- Outstanding Debt = Principal + Interest
						= X + rX
						= (1+r)X

# General Perspective on Interest Rates:
- Like any other price, interest rates are determined by market activity.
- Interest rates are prices negotiated between the borrowers and lenders of money
- The market of borrowers and lenders is diverse collection of markets which are usually viewed as divided into 2 classes:
	- __Money markets:__ short term loans, primarily with loan terms up to a year
	- __Bond markets:__ debt with longer terms than a year
- Interest rates are also heavily influenced by actions of governments and central banks.

# Term Structures of Interest Rates:
- Interest rates have term structure. They are functions of loan term. You will be charged different interest rate if you borrow money for 5 years, than if you borrow money for 3 months
- r(t) is notation used to denote the interest rate for borrowing money for a loan term of t
	- For example: r(2) = annual interest rate for a 2 year loan
