# Interest Rates:
- are measures of the price charged in the economy to borrow money
- __Terminology:__ The charge levied to borrow money is called __interest__
- __Principal:__ is the amount of money borrowed in a loan. 
- The __interest rate__ is the fraction of the principal of a loan that will be charged as interest per unit time.
- The __annual interest rate__ is an interest rate for which the implicit time unit is 1 year
-- Quotes interest rates are usually annual interest rates. In this course interest rates are annual rates unless otherwise stated.

# Mathematics of Interest Rates:
- Suppose we take out a loan for X (ie principal = X) at an annual interest rate of r. If we hold the loan for 1 year how much interest will be charged:
	- Interest rate for 1 year = rX
- If we make no payments, then our total debt after 1 year is:
	- Outstanding Debt = Principal + Interest
						= X + rX
						= (1+r)X

# General Perspective on Interest Rates:
- Like any other price, interest rates are determined by market activity.
- Interest rates are prices negotiated between the borrowers and lenders of money
- The market of borrowers and lenders is diverse collection of markets which are usually viewed as divided into 2 classes:
	- __Money markets:__ short term loans, primarily with loan terms up to a year
	- __Bond markets:__ debt with longer terms than a year
- Interest rates are also heavily influenced by actions of governments and central banks.

# Term Structures of Interest Rates:
- Interest rates have term structure. They are functions of loan term. You will be charged different interest rate if you borrow money for 5 years, than if you borrow money for 3 months
- r(t) is notation used to denote the interest rate for borrowing money for a loan term of t
	- For example: r(2) = annual interest rate for a 2 year loan

- r(t, T) donates the rate maturing at date T observed at time t. This implies the term to maturity is T-t

# Forces that shape the Interest Rates:
- Interest rates are prices negotiated between money lenders and money borrowers on markets
- Borrower wants to borrow money as cheaply as possible, and so will take the lowest interest rate possible
- Lender wants to earn highest possible interest rate, but the primary cost to the lender is the risk of loss of investment.
- __Risk__ plays is central role in determing the interest rates
- __Riskier investments__ require higher __interest rates__
- __Risks__ are different for different term structures. Longer tenures have higher risk
- Model that fits reality well is to regard central banks as setting a base level for interest rates. Other interest rate levels are then relized as adjustments to central bank rates.

# Risk Free Interest Rates:
- Interest rates when there is no risk (you get your investment back and hence there is no risk)
- __Risk free rates__ is a fanciful idea but is core concept of derivative pricing, used universally in the subject.
- __SECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE (SOFR)__ comes very close to being a actual risk free interest rate
