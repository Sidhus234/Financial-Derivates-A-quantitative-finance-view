<h1>Options</h1>
Options are contracts between two counterparties that give one of the counterparties the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a particular asset to or from the other counterparty at a price agreed to upon entering the contract. 

<li>An option to buy is called a <b>call</b>.</li>
<li>An option to sell is called a <b>put</b>.</li>
<li>The counterparty with the option is the option <b>buyer</b> or option <b>holder</b>. They buyer <b>exercises</b> the option if she chooses to buy or sell.</li>
<li>The other counterparty, who must accept the choice of the option buyer is called the option <b>seller</b> or the option <b>writer</b>.</li>

<h2>Specification of Option Contracts</h2>

To define an option contract, the underlying asset, the quantity of the asset, the type (call or put), the strike price, and the expiration date or expiry must be specified. Options are written on stocks and stock indexes, currencies, commodities, interest rate products, and on futures. The __strike price__ is the price at which the underlying will be bought or sold if the option is exercised. The __expiry__ is the time of termination of the option. In addition, the exercise tupe must be specified.
<li>A <b>European Option</b> is an option that can only be exercised at the expiration date.</li>
<li>An <b>American option</b> is one that may be exercised any time between the contract origination and expiry.</li>

In addition, like forwards and futures, options may be settled either by physical delivery of the underlying or may be cash settled. Options trade in both OTC and exchange traded markets. Like forward contracts, counterparty credit risk is a major risk source for OTC traded options. And like futures contracts, exchange-traded options are margined and marked to market so that counterparty credit risk is a very minor issue for options on exchanges.

<h3>Option Positions</h3>
The option holder is said to have the long position in the option. The option writer is said to have the short position. There are then, 4 basic positions for an investor:
<ol>
  <li>A long call position.</li>
  <li>A long put position.</li>
  <li>A short call position.</li>
  <li>A short put position.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Moneyness</h3>
Terminology denoting the status of an option when the spot (underlying) price is above, below, or equal to the strike price:
<li>An option is <b>in the money</b> if a call and spot > strike or a put and spot < strike.</li>
<li>An option is <b>out of money</b> if a call and spot < strike or a put and spot > strike.</li>
<li>An option is <b>at the money</b> if spot=strike (for both calls and puts).</li>

<h3>Option Premium</h3>
Once an option holder owns an option, they have no downside risk.
